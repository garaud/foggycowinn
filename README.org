* About

"FoggyCowInn" comes from "FogCowInn", an anagram of "own config". You have
theses following directories:

- =dotfiles=: generic "rc" configuration files for bash, zsh, etc.
- =emacs=: a few ELisp files to configure my Emacs 24 environment.

* Todos

  - Avoid downloading/installing Emacs extensions manually. Use a packaging
    system instead.
  - Add a =powerline= configuration.
  - Add an =i3= configuration.
