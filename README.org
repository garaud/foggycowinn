* About

'FoggyCowInn' is an anagram of "my own config". You have theses following
directories:

- =dotfiles=: generic "rc" configuration files for bash, zsh, etc.
- =emacs=: a few ELisp files to configure my Emacs 24 environment.

* Todos

  - Avoid downloading/installing Emacs extensions manually. Use a packaging
    system instead.
