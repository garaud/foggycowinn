* About

List of Emacs Lisp files for my own Emacs configuration.

* How to use it?
** Copy the FoggyCowInn Emacs directory

Do =git clone http://git.gitorious.org/foggycowinn/foggycowinn.git= or
 =git clone git://gitorious.org/foggycowinn/foggycowinn.git=.

** Create or modify your Emacs configuration file

Take a look the the =.emacs.example= in the =emacs= directory.

The =emacs_init.el= is the main configuration file. It loads the different
files =foggy_*.el=.

** Emacs 24 or Emacs 23

I use Emacs 24 for a while now. These configuration should not work with
Emacs 23.

* Packages List

  See =emacs/foggy_packages-list.el=

* Turn me into a HTML/PDF file

  This operation requires the mode Org-mode --- http://orgmode.org/

  Open this file with Emacs and do:

  - =M-x org-export-as-pdf RET=
  - =M-x org-export-as-html RET=

  if you want to make a PDF --- via LaTeX --- or a HTML file.
