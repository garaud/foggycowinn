* Import new configuration files: Emacs, vim, Git, Bash, ...
* Write a README
* Add a License
* Write a script to easily copy/install these configuration files in your account
* Try to list necessary emacs packages which are used
* Add a shell-script to batch compile emacs configuration file
* Add some contents about Emacs server to the emacs/README.org file.
* Write a THANKS file
* Find a way to test Emacs configuration without copy/install everything
* Replace (load-path "~/applications/emacs/package-name") by a more generic
  one. May be ~/.emacs.d/package-base is a good one.
* Clean up 'emacs/foggy_dev.el': Python part and C++ part. Too many comments !
