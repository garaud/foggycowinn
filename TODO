* Import new configuration files: Emacs, vim, Git, Bash, ...
* Write a README
* Add a License
* Add some contents about Emacs server to the emacs/README.org file.
* Write a THANKS file
* Find a way to test Emacs configuration without copy/install everything
* Clean up 'emacs/foggy_dev.el': Python part and C++ part. Too many comments !
* Explain how to install 'auto-complete'. A complete installation ---
   more complex than a copy of the project --- is needed.
